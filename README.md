# Getting started

1.  First set up your virtualenv (ideally under the conventional "vendor" directory) with `virtualenv vendor` 
2. Activate the virtualenvironment and install the pip requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Create a secrets.yaml in the format of the secrets.yaml.template. This should hold the connection string to whatever backend you choose to use
4. If you're using a new backend, you can bootstrap some exercises into it by running the `bootstrap_exercises.py`.
