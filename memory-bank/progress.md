# Project Progress: Nerdouts

## What Works

### Core Functionality
- ✅ **Exercise Management**: Database models and storage for exercises with categories
- ✅ **Static Workouts**: Predefined workout routines from both code and database
- ✅ **Dynamic Workouts**: Algorithm for generating workouts based on time and category weights
- ✅ **Web Interface**: FastAPI server with templates for workout selection and execution
- ✅ **Voice Guidance**: Text-to-speech integration for exercise announcements (macOS)
- ✅ **Music Integration**: Spotify control via AppleScript (macOS)
- ✅ **Real-Time Communication**: WebSocket-based workout progress tracking

### User Flows
- ✅ **Static Workout Selection**: Users can select from predefined workouts
- ✅ **Dynamic Workout Configuration**: Users can specify time and category weights
- ✅ **Custom Workout Creation**: Users can create and save custom static workouts
- ✅ **Workout Execution**: Voice-guided workout execution with music integration

### Technical Implementation
- ✅ **Database Abstraction**: SQLAlchemy ORM with support for multiple backends
- ✅ **Exercise Categories**: Four-category system with configurable weights
- ✅ **Side-Specific Exercises**: Support for exercises targeting specific body sides
- ✅ **Configuration Management**: JSON and YAML-based configuration
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Basic error handling for database and speech operations

## What's Left to Build

### Bug Fixes
- ❌ **Duplicate Workouts**: Fix issue with duplicate workouts in static workout generator
- ❌ **Countdown Timer**: Repair 10-second countdown functionality
- ❌ **Database Writing**: Fix workout database writing for both dynamic and static workouts
- ❌ **Static Workout Conflicts**: Resolve conflicts between code and database static workouts

### Feature Enhancements
- ❌ **Required/Excluded Exercises**: Add ability to specify required/excluded exercises
- ❌ **Docker Containerization**: Implement Docker support for easier deployment
- ❌ **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Improve speech and music integration for non-macOS platforms
- ❌ **User Authentication**: Add user accounts and personalized workout history
- ❌ **Mobile Optimization**: Enhance mobile experience for web interface

### Code Improvements
- ❌ **Refactoring**: Improve workout generation logic for better maintainability
- ❌ **Error Recovery**: Enhance error handling and recovery mechanisms
- ❌ **Test Coverage**: Expand test suite for core functionality
- ❌ **Documentation**: Improve inline documentation and user guides

## Current Status

### Completed Milestones
1. ✅ **Core Data Models**: Exercise, Workout, WorkoutExercise, StaticWorkout
2. ✅ **Web Interface**: FastAPI server with Jinja2 templates
3. ✅ **Workout Generation**: Static and dynamic workout creation
4. ✅ **Voice & Music Integration**: Basic implementation for macOS

### In Progress
1. 🔄 **Database Writing**: Fixing issues with saving completed workouts
2. 🔄 **Static Workout Management**: Resolving conflicts between sources
3. 🔄 **Countdown Timer**: Repairing functionality

### Planned Next
