# Project Brief: Nerdouts

## Overview
Nerdouts is a workout management system designed to create, manage, and guide users through customized workout routines. The application focuses on providing structured workouts with different exercise categories (physical therapy, stretching, strength training, and rolling/recovery) and supports both static (predefined) and dynamic (automatically generated) workout sessions.

   - Support for exercises with different sides (left/right)
   - Track exercise duration, repetitions, and instructions

2. **Workout Generation**
   - Create static (predefined) workouts
   - Generate dynamic workouts based on time constraints and category preferences
   - Allow customization of workout parameters

3. **Workout Execution**
   - Guide users through exercises with voice prompts
   - Integrate with music services (e.g., Spotify) for workout accompaniment
   - Provide countdown timers and exercise transitions

4. **Web Interface**
   - Display workout options and exercise details
   - Allow creation of custom static workouts
   - Configure and start dynamic workouts

5. **Data Persistence**
   - Store exercises, workouts, and user preferences
   - Support different database backends

## Project Goals

1. Create an accessible system for managing personalized workout routines
2. Provide voice guidance to eliminate the need to look at screens during workouts
3. Balance different exercise categories for comprehensive fitness
4. Support physical therapy and rehabilitation exercises alongside traditional strength training
5. Enable easy customization of workouts based on user preferences and needs
