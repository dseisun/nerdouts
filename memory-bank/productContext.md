# Product Context: Nerdouts

## Problem Statement
Traditional workout applications often lack flexibility for personalized routines, especially for individuals with specific needs like physical therapy exercises or rehabilitation. Many apps focus solely on standard strength training without considering a holistic approach to fitness that includes stretching, mobility work, and recovery techniques.

Additionally, most workout apps require users to constantly look at screens during exercises, which disrupts flow and proper form. Voice guidance is often limited or non-existent, making it difficult to follow along without visual cues.

## Solution
Nerdouts addresses these challenges by providing:

1. **Personalized Workout Generation**
   - Combines different exercise categories (physical therapy, stretching, strength, rolling/recovery)
   - Balances workout composition based on configurable weights for each category
   - Supports both predefined (static) and automatically generated (dynamic) workouts

2. **Hands-Free Workout Experience**
   - Voice prompts announce exercises, sides, and repetitions
   - Music integration (Spotify) with automatic pausing during announcements
   - Countdown timers with voice notifications

3. **Flexible Exercise Management**
   - Support for exercises that target specific sides of the body
   - Detailed exercise descriptions and instructions
   - Customizable exercise parameters (time, repetitions)

## User Experience Goals

### Primary User Flows
1. **Static Workout Flow**
   - User selects a predefined workout from a list
   - System guides user through each exercise with voice prompts
   - Music plays during exercises and pauses during announcements
   - User can skip exercises or end workout early if needed

2. **Dynamic Workout Flow**
   - User specifies total workout time
   - User adjusts category weights (physical therapy, stretch, strength, rolling)
   - System generates a balanced workout meeting the time constraint
   - User follows the generated workout with voice guidance

3. **Custom Workout Creation**
   - User selects exercises from the database to create a new static workout
   - User names and saves the workout for future use
   - System stores the workout for later selection

### Key Experience Principles
1. **Minimal Visual Interaction**: Users should be able to complete workouts with minimal need to look at screens
2. **Flexibility**: Support for various exercise types and workout structures
3. **Guidance**: Clear voice instructions for proper exercise execution
4. **Personalization**: Ability to tailor workouts to individual needs and preferences
5. **Consistency**: Reliable workout structure that follows established patterns

## Target Users
- Individuals following physical therapy or rehabilitation programs
- Fitness enthusiasts who want balanced workouts incorporating multiple exercise types
